            <h1>Professor's Research Project: Learning Databases Tool <br>[August 2023 - December 2023]</h1>
            <p>It was towards the end of August. I didn't have any clue what I'd do for my capstone
                project requirement. But then, it struck me: "Since I have done well in this CSS475 database systems
                class and
                shown
                work ethic, maybe my professor would let me on one of his student projects." And so he did, he let me do
                the onboarding early where I got acquainted with C# and Azure DevOps along with techniques like
                red-yellow-green testing. I then used this to build out more of his project requirements and fix some
                bugs
                outlined in Azure DevOps like a work order system. When done, I'd get these changes approved by him just
                to make sure things run smoothly. Throughout the project, it involved a lot of work with ASTs, graphs,
                MySQL language, an SQL database, reusable React.js components, CSS styling, Dotnet, and designing
                according to a
                visual specification made during Zoom meetings. All of the work culminated into making a version zero
                product that allows
                students to not only to translate relational algebra (RA) to structured query language (SQL), but also
                execute the queries to see if the translation matches the resulting query they want. Personally, I would
                have found this helpful as a tool in my CSS475 class, so I hope other students find it helpful when it
                is used.</p>

            <h1>Cisco Networking Academy <br>[September 2017 - July 2021]</h1>
            <p>In the Cisco Networking Academy, I have been fortunate enough to be able to learn many things. In the
                CCNA class I was able to learn about both the theory and hands-on configuration of computer networking
                equipment. In the CCNP class, I was able to learn more advanced topics such as configuring IP phones via
                Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) and getting introduced to cloud-based RADIUS authentication.
                In the CCNA Security class, I learned about how to do basic firewall configuration with web traffic
                filtering. In both the CCNP and CCNA Security classes, I have been able to do many labs demonstrating
                this hands-on work by working with classmates.</p>
