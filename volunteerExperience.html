        <p>One of the best opportunities I've had so far was when I went to the island of Antigua to set up and perform
            maintenance on the computer networks there. In doing so, me and my group of four other students went around
            to various primary schools to replace the rusting computers, deteriorating Cat5e/Cat6 cables, and older
            Cisco switches. The reason the existing equipment rusted was due to the island's air current that washes
            over the island like a cool breeze. However, this breeze carries moisture from the ocean, thus provided
            ample conditions for rusting. <br><br>For the rusting computers, we went ahead and replaced them with
            laptops for when mobility or computer performance was an issue. For the cables, we found that some of the
            dangling cables exposed to the elements of weather, or to primary school students were prone to damage. To
            address this, my group decided to replace these long-running cables with Ubiquiti point-to-point bridges
            (P2Ps). In other situations, we decided to restrain newly installed cables with zip ties to pipes and other
            school infrastructure. For the old network switches, we found that either they were no longer operating to
            their full capacity, or just not working. Thus, we replaced these with new switches. These switches were
            mostly Cisco Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches that we needed for powering the Ubiquiti P2Ps and Cisco
            access points. Besides performing maintenance on the existing computer networks, we also installed Cisco
            access points that were preconfigured before the trip by another Cisco Networking Academy student. We used
            these for the laptops being installed since the students needed mobility when doing class work.</p>

        <p>Overall, the trip was fun since it gave me the opportunity to get hands-on experience with some basic remote
            network technician work.</p>
